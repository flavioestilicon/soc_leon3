This project includes:
	1. C++ bit-to bit model of the full system:
		- CPU Leon3 + DSU3
		- AHB controller
		- JTAG module
		- RAM
  
  2. C++ software is generating all input signals for the SoC
  	- SCLK (66 MHz), SRESET
  	- JTag signals: TCK, TMS, TDO, TRESET
  	- GNSS sensor signals: ClkADC, I, Q

  3. Source VHDL files by Gaisler

This software allows to generate test-bench files of the whole system
and any single module of the SoC. It allows to work with real firmware
as with the system emulator.
