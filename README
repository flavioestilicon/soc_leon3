This project splited on several parts:
  1. C++ bit-to bit model of the full system. This part is implemented as a library 
  and describes next modules:
		- CPU Leon3 + DSU3
		- AHB controller
		- JTAG module
		- AHB RAM
		- GNSS channels module
  
  2. C++ host software. This part is used to generate the whole set of signals
  for the SoC library, such as:
  	- SCLK (66 MHz), SRESET
  	- JTag signals: TCK, TMS, TDO, TRESET
  	- GNSS sensor signals: ClkADC, I, Q
  This software layer may be directly used to generate testbench patterns for verification,
  power consumption evaluation and other of the whole System On Chip on real signal 
  processing.
