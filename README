  The main objective of this project is to provide a reference 
C++ design for the development of the processor system, which is
build on the Leon3 core by Aeroflex Gaisler and includes our
proprietary GNSS navigation module. This software allows:
  - Load execution code into internal RAM of SoC using 
    compilation output file (.elf).
  - generates test-bench vectors of the whole system or
    any single module and use them directly during RTL 
    simulation as reference or use them to compute switching 
    activity.
  - JTAG and UART signal generators are also included.
